🗂️ Project: Todo App with Time-bound Tasks
Core Features (MVP)

User Authentication

Signup / Login (use DRF JWT or simple TokenAuth).

Each user only sees their own tasks.

Task Management (CRUD)

Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks.

Fields:

title (string) → e.g. “Read Book”

description (optional)

start_time (datetime)

end_time (datetime)

status (pending, in-progress, done)

Validation

end_time must be after start_time.

No overlapping tasks for the same user (extra challenge).

Extra Features (Good for Resume)

Recurring tasks (e.g., Gym every Mon/Wed 2–4pm).

Daily/Weekly View API → so frontend can render like a mini calendar.

Search & Filters → filter by date, status, or keyword.

Reminders/Notifications (send email when task is about to start → use Celery + Redis, or a simple cron).
